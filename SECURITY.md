## Reporting security problems

**DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE** to report a security problem. Instead, please
send an email to charled.breteche@gmail.com

## Security point of contact

The security point of contact is Charles-Edouard Breteche at charled.breteche@gmail.com.
Charles-Edouard responds to security incident reports as fast as possible, within one
business day at the latest.

If you obtain no response then please contact support@github.com
who can disable any access until the security incident is resolved.

## Incident response process

In case an incident is discovered or reported, we will follow the following
process to contain, respond and remediate:

### 1. Containment

The first step is to find out the root cause, nature and scope of the incident.

- Is still ongoing? If yes, first priority is to stop it.
- Is the incident outside of my influence? If yes, first priority is to contain it.
- Find out who knows about the incident and who is affected.
- Find out what data was potentially exposed.

### 2. Response

After the initial assessment and containment to our best abilities, we will
document all actions taken in a response plan.

### 3. Remediation

Once the incident is confirmed to be resolved, we will summarize the lessons
learned from the incident and create a list of actions we will take to prevent
it from happening again.

## Vulnerability management plans

### Keep permissions to a minimum

Use the least amount of access to limit the impact of possible
security incidents.

### Secure accounts with access

The [KLoops GitHub Organization](https://github.com/kloops-io) requires 2FA authorization
for all members.
