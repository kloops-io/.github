## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug ?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**,
  and instead to refer to our [security policy](SECURITY.md).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/kloops-io/kloops/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/kloops-io/kloops/issues/new).
  Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug ?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one ?**

* Open an issue on GitHub to discuss the feature, get feedback,  and start writing code.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code ?**

* Ask any question about KLoops in the [kloops mailing list](TODO).

* Alternatively you can create an issue with the **Question** issue template.

KLoops is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join [the team](TODO)!
